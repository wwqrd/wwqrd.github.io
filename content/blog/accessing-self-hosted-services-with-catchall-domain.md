I recently set up the first node for my homelab. While it was easy to spin up various services, accessing them wasn‚Äôt so straightforward ‚Äîremembering ports for each service was a hassle ü§Ø. It really came together when I got a catchall domain working.

#### Why a Catchall Domain?  üåê

Traefik offers powerful tools for redirecting traffic and rewriting headers, but things don‚Äôt always go smoothly. Many Docker-based apps are built to assume they‚Äôre running at the root of a domain, that can cause unexpected behaviour üõë. Rather than figure this out on an app by app basis, I could largely sidestep this problem by using sub-domains.

For the domain itself, many people default to `.local` for local services, but this can cause conflicts with mDNS. Others opt for a real domain, but that comes with two drawbacks: it costs money, and your DNS records are public. Turns out that `home.arpa` is specifically reserved by the IETF for home networking üè°. It‚Äôs free, private and perfect for me since I don‚Äôt need to route public traffic to my homelab üôå.

So this is the setup:

- I have a single node with a known IP (`192.168.1.20`).
- I will route all subdomains for `home.arpa` to my known node IP
- I will use a `home.arpa` subdomain for each service, e.g. `pihole.home.arpa`
- All traffic on port 80/443 (e.g. web traffic) hit will hit my reverse proxy (Traefik) on that device.
- I can set Traefik tags on my Nomad jobs to route them by `Host()`
- This means I can configure the subdomain in my Nomad job files and it will automagically work ‚ú®!

#### DNS Configuration with Pi-hole üõ†Ô∏è

So how to do a catchall? Turns out, Pi-hole already has **dnsmasq** built in, which can handle this easily ü§©. The simplest setup is adding an address entry like so:

```python
# in /etc/dnsmasq.d/09-home.conf
address=/.home.arpa/192.168.1.20
```

With this in place, every subdomain under `home.arpa` resolves to the IP address `192.168.1.20`. For example:

- `pihole.home.arpa` ‚Üí 192.168.1.20
- `home-assistant.home.arpa` ‚Üí 192.168.1.20

üëå

```python
tags = [
    "traefik.enable=true",
    "traefik.http.routers.pihole.rule=Host(`pihole.home.arpa`)",
]
```

#### Handling Remote Access üåç

This worked great for me on my LAN, but when I‚Äôm away from home, connecting via VPN it breaks because that IP is no longer valid ‚ùå. Fortunately we can configure for this too, and include information about the subnets that each IP is relevant to:

```python
address=/.home.arpa/192.168.1.0/24/192.168.1.20  # LAN ip for node
address=/.home.arpa/100.64.0.0/10/100.66.66.66  # VPN ip for node
```

Now I can let networking magic ‚ú® route my traffic to the most appropriate IP, so long as we use the pihole as our DNS server, but
I don't want to use that for the rest of my traffic when I'm on the VPN, because it'll add a slow round trip to all my DNS queries.

#### Split DNS with Tailscale üõ°Ô∏è

Tailscale makes this easy to fix with its **split DNS** feature. This allows you to delegate DNS resolution for a specific TLD (`home.arpa`), everything else can go to your regular server. To set it up:

1. Open the Tailscale admin panel.
2. Go to the **DNS** section.
3. Add a custom nameserver for `home.arpa`.
4. Done!

Now, whether I‚Äôm at home or connected via VPN, my services are easily accessible using their subdomains ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Setting up a catchall domain with Traefik, Pi-hole, and `home.arpa` has made managing and accessing my homelab services easy. Subdomains keep everything organized and avoid the quirks of app-specific configurations, while Pi-hole and Tailscale handle DNS seamlessly for both local and remote access. With this setup, expanding my homelab feels even more straightforward.
