We are in the midst of the Coronavirus pandemic (2020) at the moment. I don't have anything
to add that hasn't already been said, but I wanted to jot down some of my present thoughts on it.

When I first heard about the outbreak in Wuhan, China I strongly suspected it would make it's way
around the world. It's highly infectious, and relatively non-lethal, meaning that it had none of
the self limiting features of other recent outbreaks (SARS and MERS). It turns out that some people
are even asymptomatic, so can spread it without knowing it.

Well it made it here to the UK, and the rest of Europe. We're all looking to the outbreak in Italy
for an idea of what will happen here next. They are considered to be a couple of weeks ahead of us
on the epidemiological curve.

Italy has been on lockdown since the 9th of March following an earlier restriction in Lombardy
and the neighbouring provinces. Those original restrictions were leaked early which lead to many
people fleeing the area - obviously not great for controlling the spread of the disease. Many other
places in Europe have a full lockdown, with people being unable to leave their houses, sick or no.

Here recommendations and restrictions have gradually ramped up over the past two weeks. Initially
we were simply advised to wash our hands more thoroughly and self isolate if we had any symptoms.
Then we were advised to avoid any non-essential social contact with each other, and to work from
home if possible; these were voluntary measures only and were not enforced. Many people followed
the guidance, but many didn't - as without mandated closures people still needed to go out to work
etc. The "Panic buying" phenomena may be an illusion. If we each took sensible precautions and
stocked up a little extra, with a minority going overboard, it is likely that the cumulative effect
would outsize the actions of a few bad players, who have since been scapegoated. We are advised
there are not expected to be any food shortages, it's simply a case of not being able to fill
the shelves fast enough.

As of yesterday pubs, restaurants and gyms were all closed until further notice. People put out of
work are to be supported by the government. In some ways it's a relief that there are no longer any
questions about what we should do ("is it morally okay to do x/y/z?"), but the idea of 12 weeks\* of
isolation is daunting.
