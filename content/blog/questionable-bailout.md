A business provides goods and services, in exchange doing that efficiently they are given
leeway to extract a profit. A company is an entity *defined by the public* with that mandate.
They exploit but they also provide. We are okay with this practice because of the mantra
of efficiency. A credo which also includes freedom to succeed and freedom to fail - otherwise
known as the invisible hand of the market. For the sake of argument let us take this ideology
at face value.

The public are about to pay salaries in order to keep shuttered buisnesses afloat.
Will bosses still get their bonuses? --probably. Doesn't this render mute the justification
profit from taking on risk?

Given that essential work must continue, does that the remaining work is non-essential?
We are effectively "reserving" labour for this non-essential work. Meanwhile there isn't
enough labour where it *is* needed. 

Bonuses are protected for now, but the furloughed are still under seige. They know that they may
not have jobs to go back to despite the intervention. So let's not. Instead let's improve
welfare, support the population directly through Universal Basic Income. Let's reset exploitative
non-essential buisness and double down on the essentials.
