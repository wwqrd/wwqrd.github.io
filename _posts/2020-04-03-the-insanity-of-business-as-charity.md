Business exists for a sole purpose - to provide goods and services. As a reward for doing that they
can extract a profit. A company is an entity *defined by the public* with that mandate.

When they cease to fulfill this role they can be disbanded. So why are we bailing out business
again? We are about to pay people to do nothing in order to prop up existing businesses. Will they
still get their bonuses? It renders mute the justification profit from taking on risk.

Given that we may be in lockdown for some time does it really make sense to interfere with the
"invisible hand of the market"? Maybe some business needs to fail so that labour can go elsewhere
and the economy can adapt. Maybe there should be some protected industries, but not all of them.

So buisness is safe for now, but the furloughed are still under seige, they may not have jobs to
go back to despite the intervention -- so lets not. Let's instead improve welfare, support the
population directly through Universal Basic Income. Allow people to innovate and move on with
their lives.
